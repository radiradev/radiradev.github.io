This is my personal website and blog. I am a [data physicist](https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/202311/backpage.cfm) working at CERN on the analysis software for a next-generation neutrino-oscillation experiment - [DUNE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Underground_Neutrino_Experiment).

I focus on applying state of the art deep learning models to enhance the capabilities of traditional techniques for classification, simulation and reweighting.

Outside of work, I like to spend time in the mountains - hiking, skiing and mountain biking.

To build the website I used [astro](https://astro.build/) with the [astro-paper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) theme.
